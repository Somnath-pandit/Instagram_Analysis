## Introduction

In this project, we delve into an Instagram-like dataset to perform advanced SQL analytics. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, enhancing your ability to work with real-world data scenarios.

## Database Schema

The dataset represents a simplified version of a social media platform with the following core components:

- **Users**: Information about users, including their IDs and usernames.
- **Posts**: Details of the photos posted by users, including post IDs, user IDs, timestamps, and captions.
- **Likes**: Records of which users liked which posts.
- **Comments**: Details of comments made by users on posts, including comment IDs, user IDs, post IDs, and timestamps.
- **Followers**: Information on which users follow other users.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To enhance proficiency in advanced SQL functions and techniques.
2. To perform intricate data analysis tasks using a variety of SQL queries.
3. To gain insights into user behavior and content interaction on a social media platform.
4. To prepare for real-world data analysis challenges through hands-on practice.

## SQL Concepts and Techniques

Throughout this project, we utilized a range of advanced SQL concepts and techniques, including:

- **Window Functions**: To perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.
- **Grouping**: To aggregate data based on specific criteria.
- **Subqueries**: To perform nested queries and retrieve specific data insights.
- **Joins**: To combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: To simplify complex queries and improve readability.

## Detailed Analysis Tasks

Here are some of the detailed analysis tasks performed in this project:

1. **User Engagement Analysis**:
   - Identify the most active users based on posts, likes, and comments.
   - Analyze user engagement patterns over time.

2. **Content Performance Analysis**:
   - Determine which types of posts receive the most likes and comments.
   - Identify peak times for user engagement.

3. **Follower Network Analysis**:
   - Analyze the follower relationships between users.
   - Identify influential users based on their follower count.

4. **Post Interaction Analysis**:
   - Examine the distribution of likes and comments across posts.
   - Identify posts with unusually high or low engagement.

## Insights and Findings

From my analysis, I gained several key insights:

- **User Activity**: Certain users are significantly more active, contributing a majority of posts, likes, and comments.
- **Engagement Patterns**: User engagement peaks during specific times of the day, suggesting optimal posting times.
- **Content Trends**: Posts with certain types of content or hashtags receive higher engagement.
- **Influential Users**: A small number of users have a large follower base, indicating their influence within the network.

## Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive exercise in advanced SQL analytics, allowing us to extract valuable insights from a complex dataset. By working through these tasks, we enhanced our SQL skills and prepared for real-world data analysis scenarios.
